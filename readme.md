[Read more about talkso](https://github.com/iamso/talkso).

## Install

```bash
npm i -g talkso-cli
```

## Requirements

Your system must meet the following requirements:

- Node >= 7.6.0
- ImageMagick CLI

## Usage

Create a markdown file, see the [example](example.md) for help.

### Example

Create an example markdown file, showing all the possible options:

```bash
talkso -e
# or
talkso --example
```

### Watch

Run the following command from the markdown files directory:

```bash
talkso -w
# or
talkso --watch
```

The watch command copys the necessary css- and js-files to the directory and creates the html file(s). It also starts the server, see [Serve](#serve).

### Serve

```bash
talkso -s
# or
talkso --serve
```

The serve command starts an express server. The port can be specified with the following commands:

```bash
PORT=7000 talkso -s
#Â or
talkso -s -p 7000
# or
talkso -s --port 7000
```

If no port is specified, the default port 8000 is used.

*NOTE: The port can also be passed in with the watch command.*

### Build

Run the following command from the markdown files directory:

```bash
talkso
```

The build command copys the necessary css- and js-files to the directory and creates the html file(s).
